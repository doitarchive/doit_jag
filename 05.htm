<p><tt>Hacking the VLM - A Brief Introduction</tt>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>&#183; The Good News
<br>
</p>
<p>There is a backdoor left in the VLM which allows the user to get
at the edit mode that was used to create the banks of VLM effects. You
can get in there and roll-your-own FX, and it's not hard to come up
with stuff that is a *lot* better than many of the default FX.
<br>
</p>
<p>&#183; The Bad News
<br>
</p>
<p>There is no provision for saving your hacks. They are entirely
transient, and you can wave them bye-bye as soon as you switch to
another FX bank -and unfortunately, whenever you open the lid of the
Toilet to change the CD, it switches banks into a special Jaguar-logo
bank, and it's bye bye hacks. Bummer, I wish it didn't do that, 'coz
otherwise I'd just leave my VLM on all the time and evolve 9
banksworth of top hacks...
<br>
</p>
<p>Also, the edit interface is buggy and pretty user-hostile; it's
got no error- checking and it's possible to crash the VLM, or slow it
down to a crawl, if you tweak certain parameters out of range. Hell,
it was never intended for end-users, only for use by a certain
deranged bovine.
<br>
</p>
<p>&#183; Why Bother Then?
<br>
</p>
<p>Because it's fun. Because if you're interested, you can find out a
lot about how the VLM works. Because a lot of the default FX are
fairly non-optimal, largely 'coz at the time I was designing the banks
I had pneumonia and was feeling like Bovine Backscatter, and I always
find that I make better FX when I feel good. And although you can't
save the hacks, you can do what I do, and keep a tape in the VCR and
lay down some vid whenever you come up with a particularly nice one.
<br>
</p>
<p>&#183; How do I get there?
<br>
</p>
<p>Easy. Select the effect you want to base your hack on. Then, in
VLM-mode, hold down *,1,3,0 on the Jaggi control pad. This should
bring up a menu called Spectrum and Triggers. That's not it though -
that was just a red herring to confuse people looking for the hack ;-)
While on the Spectrum and Triggers screen, press up,down,up,down... 8
times (so the cursor wraps from Trigger 1 to Trigger 5 and back again
8x) and then the display will change to Edit Mode. At that point
you're in.
<br>
</p>
<p>&#183; What do I do when I get there then?
<br>
</p>
<p>Okay, first it helps to have some idea of what is going on inside
any particular VLM setting. Each individual setting consists of up to
six effects, each of which can take a shitload of parameters, which
define how that effect changes over time. Parameters can be attached
to waveform generators, to user control from the joypad, or to the
spectrum triggers to create an audio-responsive effect.
<br>
</p>
<p>The most common types of effect you will see in the VLM are:
<br>
</p>
<p>Digital Video Feedback area:
<br>
<br>DVF is what gives you all those cool swirly screen-filling
patterns and persistence fields. It is, however, quite an expensive
effect in terms of proc power (one is throwing rather a lot of pixels
around doing scaled rotates of the entire screen)... if you can live
with a smaller DVF area on some of the effects the speed and
responsiveness of many of the effects can be greatly enhanced. I have
a whole new class of 60Hz feedback FX that I could kick myself for not
putting in the default banks...
<br>
</p>
<p>Draw Spectrum As Intensities:
<br>
<br>This basically plots the output of the FFT through the symmetry
generator. On its own, or combined with DVF, this is a good setting to
use for effects that you want to be precisely audio-reactive. Put it
over some nice DVF or a persistence field, lovely.
<br>
</p>
<p>Draw a Ring of Pixels:
<br>
<br>Does just that, through the sym generator, with various parameters
applied so you can change phases, number of points,pixel size, etc...
a very versatile thing, simple though it is.
<br>
</p>
<p>Draw Plasma:
<br>
<br>Draws a tile of plasma on the screen. Useful for putting in the
middle of a nice DVF field as a source effect. Can be programmed to
flash on trigger band events too. Try hooking oscillators up to the XY
position when it's in a 60Hz DVF field - yummy.
<br>
</p>
<p>Empty slots cannot be edited. Time was when pushing B on an empty
slot would bring up two pages' worth of FX that you could build in
there, but sadly that came out. I wish I had never taken it out now.
Damn, and I wish I had not removed Save Bank either...
<br>
</p>
<p>There are a few others, starfields and the like. Play with them.
Some of them are quite cool.
<br>
</p>
<p>Fiddling Around With Stuff
<br>
<br>When you press B to edit an effect, you are presented with three
choices - Edit source function, which allows you to see and tweak the
parameters that make up the basis of the effect; Edit symmetry
generator, which allows you to twiddle with the sym generator, for
effects that go through that pipe (not all FX do - DVF and the plasma
don't use the sym gen at all, so changing stuff on theyr sym generator
pages does nothing useful); and Edit Source Waves. Each effect has 8
programmable waveform generators which can be attached to any of the
parameters defining the effect or the symmetry. Edit Source Waves is
where you go to adjust the speed, waveform etc of the waveform
generators.
<br>
</p>
<p>Edit Source Function
<br>
<br>If you enter this menu, you will be presented with a list of the
variables which control how that effect is displayed. In a DVF
effect's Source Function menu, for example, you will see parameters
controlling the Window Size, Scale, Rotate Angle, etc. You are free to
cursor around this menu, twiddle the values, and see what happens to
the display. (It helps to have a CD playing while you fiddle, so that
all the effects are active and you can see what you are doing). Menu
items with (X,Y) after them represent pairs of variables. When you
select a variable to edit, you will be presented with a slider, a
2-way slider, a position marker, or crosshairs, depending on the
effect. Just use the joypad to change the values. Anything you change
will stay changed for the life of your hack (that is until you change
banks or open the Toilet).
<br>
</p>
<p>While editing a variable, you may see the message 'Press * to
Attach Waveforms'. If you press *, it takes you to the Attach
Waveforms screen, which has a totally crappy and confusing UI, but
which is nonetheless the key to the cooler aspects of VLM usage. It
works in conjunction with the Waveform Edit page, and in a sane and
rational world, would have been integrated in with that page. The
wonderfully-informative Attach Waveforms screen presents two rows of
the numbers 1-8. The top row represents waveform generators linked to
this variable. If one or more of these numbers are highlighted, it
means there are generators already linked to this variable. You can
attach or detach a generator to the variable by pressing the
corresponding number key 1-8. You can attach as many generators as you
like - the resultant waveform is the sum of all the input waveforms.
<br>
</p>
<p>You also can adjust the amplitude of the waveform here. Dismally,
there is no display actually showing you the amplitude - you just have
to watch the display to see the result and kinda fish about. Also, for
some inane reason, if the waveform is attached to an X-component you
adjust the amplitude with left/right, and if it is a Y component you
use up and down. I think I was planning to put in an actual display of
the waveforms here, but I got ill and never finished it off. As it is,
it's sucky and counterintuitive. Oh well... The bottom row of 8
numbers allows you to modulate the attached waveform(s) with the
output of an envelope generated by any of the five spectrum trigger
generators. You press #, then the number of the trigger 1-5 (6, 7 and
8 are for the three joypad buttons) to toggle the trigger attach. And
for some reason, like it was never properly debugged, when you toggle
a trigger off, often the digit in the bottom row will not de-
highlight. Oops.
<br>
</p>
<p>After you have attached waveforms, you will probably want to mosey
on over to the:
<br>
</p>
<p>Edit Source Waves
<br>
<br>menu. Here, you can select a waveform generator by cursoring up
and down. While the cursor is on a generator, that wave is displayed
in the blue box. You can increase or decrease the frequency with A and
C, and slipthe phase by Left/Right. You can change the wave type by
pressing a number on the numeric pad. User X and User Y translate to
the 'position controlled by the joypad in VLM Interactive mode.
<br>
</p>
<p>Edit Symmetry Generator
<br>
<br>is a very interesting place to be for all those particle effects
and anything else that goes through the sym generator. In this menu
you can twiddle, attach waveforms to and generally piss about with
everything to do with symmetry.
<br>
</p>
<p>The sym generator uses two basic kinds of symmetry, planar 8-way
reflection, which is quick, and rotational, which is very nice but
considerably slower. The two types can be combined. Many of the items
on the Symmetry page only apply to Rotational symmetry, and will have
no effect if Rotational is switched off.
<br>
</p>
<p>You set the sym types under the Symmetry Type menu, not
surprisingly. Pressing 9 on this page toggles rotational sym off and
on, and due to quite possibly the same bug as on the Waveform Attach
screen, often the '9' in the middle will be incorrectly highlighted.
It's usually pretty obvious when rotational is on though. Keys 1-8
toggle on and off the planes of the 8-way symmetry. Set up your types,
and then go and have a fiddle with the parameters as in the Edit
Source Function mode.
<br>
</p>
<p>Since you can't add or delete effects, the nature of your hacks
will be in part defined by what effect types are in the bank you
choose to edit, so if you want to do a lot of DVF stuff, try bank 3 or
4, and if you like particles, bank 1 or 2, and so on. You can switch
between, and hack, all effects within a bank, but *if you change banks
they are lost*. Be careful!
<br>
</p>
<p>And, basically, there we have it (as I said to Flossie as I led
her into the concealing darkness of the sheep-shed). Enough stuff to
get you started playing about with VLM editing. Apologies for the
crappy UI, but I never had time to really bring it up to scratch
before I got that bloody pneumonia. As it is it was about a year
between finishing the VLM code and the release of the CD-ROM, and I
wish I had been able to spend a few more months at it. Both the FX and
the edit mode could have been a lot nicer! Oh well, next time... I've
already got some awesome stuff running on [closes his muzzle and
remembers the three letters N, D and A] ;-)
<br>
</p>
<p>and oh yeah, I better mention:
<br>
</p>
<p>CAVEATS: Here Be Bugs'n'Beasties!
<br>
</p>
<p>The error checking on the UI is at best sucky and at worst
nonexistant. It is quite possible to either choke up the VLM with some
incredibly intensive sym mode that will have it doing one frame per
Sunday, and you and even kill it with an honest to Ghu,
thank-you-and-goodnight, little-silicon-legs-in-the- air crash. There
are a few danger areas which I shall warn you of now:
<br>
</p>
<p>&#183; Positioning a DVF window too far off the edge of the screen
can kill the system
<br>&#183; Attaching waveforms to DVF window size and position can be
fatal. Look out!
<br>&#183; Attaching waveforms to the Rotational Symmetry Order can
cause it to wrap to negative, whuch translates to something greater
than 32767, which,as a sym order, will cause the system to choke most
heinously. Won't killit, but the frame rate will be measured in
minutes per frame hehe...
<br>
</p>
<p>Don't worry, killing the system will not do any permanent damage.
The default banks are tucked away snug in ROM and will be restored
when you restart the system, no matter how badly you take it down.
<br>
</p>
<p>Well, I shall go and post this now... have fun and Happy Hacking!

<br><b> VLM sound in </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>Atari Jaguar VLM
</p>
<p>Mucho thanks to Joe Britt for the pix and modification details.
<br>
</p>
<p>Atari's Virtual Light Machine (VLM), was developed by Jeff Minter,
as a sound to light hardware/software combo that was intrinsically
part of the Jaguar CD add-on unit. It synthesized interactive abstract
light patterns based on the audio data in the CD. It has 81 effects,
and although it's not a documented feature, you'll be pleased to know
that you can edit the effect settings on the VLM, although saving them
is not an option, as this feature was used essentially for debugging.
Check out the VLM Hackers Guide for further customization details. Or:
Learn the History of the VLM.
<br>
</p>
<p>The VLM graphics are quite spectacular, with the only limitation
being that you must use the realtime audio stream from an inserted CD.
Fortunately, there is a way to overcome this by modifying the unit to
accept an incoming audio feed to facilate integration into VJ setups.
<br>
</p>
<p>Joe Britt's custom modification follows:
<br>
</p>
<p>Basically, I opened up the JagCD and saw that it used a standard
Philips chipset. The decoded raw digital audio is output in a standard
high-speed serial format. I purchased an Analog to Digital evaluation
board made by Crystal for one of their 16-bit A/D converters for
approx $200. The A/D on that eval board outputs the same format, so it
was just a matter of patching in 3 signals (data, data clk, left/right
channel clock) where they would have come out of the CD chipset.
<br>
</p>
<p>You still have to have a CD in the JagCD, since it thinks that
nothing unusual is going on, but the audio from that CD never goes
anywhere. The audio going into the A/D board gets serialized by the
Crystal part and fed into the JagCD. The VLM sees that audio instead
of the CD audio, and the swirly trippy colors do their thing. Of
course, if you hook up the Jag's audio out, you hear whatever is being
fed into the A/D.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
<br>The VLM-2 is integrated into the Samsung Extiva N-2000 DVD player,
available Spring 2000.
<br>
</p>
<p>Like it's predecessor, the VLM-2 generates realtime graphics to
the audio stream of a CD put in the player. It has 100 effects, and
some of them are things that could not even be attempted using the
Jag's old hardwired graphics manipulation hardware. VLM-2's main
aesthetic is based on things that are not normally considered to be
the domain of (at least low-end) graphics systems - mist, smoke, even
fluid surfaces that appear to flow together and break apart in a
natural manner.
<br>
</p>
<p>If you're feeling in the mood, if you use the analog joystick, you
can &quot;jam&quot; along quite effectively. Although the
interactivity is quite simple - often just colour/feedback
intensity/scale changes - it's surprisingly satisfying. You can just
sit there and kinda &quot;air-guitar&quot; with your thumb (if that
makes any sense) and it looks great on the screen.
